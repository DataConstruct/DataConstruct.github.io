				<p class="testi">I've worked and collaborated with many IT professionals over the years, and Paul is extraordinary. He's a highly-talented developer, a great communicator, and a detail-oriented project manager. Paul's commitment to process management/implementation, automation, and sustainable thinking gives project teams tremendous confidence in the product development, and in his leadership. I hope to get the opportunity to work with Paul again very soon. <br /> Chris Robin ( RRC )</p>

				<h3><a href="/blog/making-the-case-for-simpler-processes/">Making The Case For Simpler Processes</a></h3>
				<p>Code is only valuable when it's in production. Until then, it's a liability. It is essential that we focus both on quickly delivering high quality software to our users and improving our processes to make that delivery easier.</p>

				<h3><a href="/blog/building-scalable-build-deployment-pipelines/">Building Scalable Build and Deployment Pipelines</a></h3>
				<p>Build and Deployment Pipelines are not a sexy subject within our industry. It's often an afterthought relegated to the last minute and cobbled together. It's also extremely hard to find resources from people who've been in the trenches and seen what has worked and what hasn't. This article is an attempt at sharing the knowledge I have from building Build and Deployment Pipelines that have deployed applications that served billions of requests daily.</p>
				<p>You may not agree with everything that is documented here and that's ok! If you are going to deviate, deviate with purpose!</p>
